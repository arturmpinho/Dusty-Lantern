## **Project Goal** 
***Dusty Lantern*** aims to be the market reference in the auction of second-hand products/belongings.

It intends to provide buyers and sellers with an intuitive and appealing platform to trade their used belongings.

With sustainability being the key-driver of innovation and the second-hand market increasing substantially during the past years, combining both contexts generates a great opportunity that must be addressed.

With this in mind the ***Dusty Lantern*** will provide like-minded people the best platform so they can give second-hand products/belongings a new life and start contributing to a more sustainable society, monetizing their own old and unused items.

### **Design Choices**
#### Fonts
![Fonts](wireframes/dusty_lantern_fonts.png)

#### Icons

Throughout out the website, I will be using icons provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "FontAwesome").

The icons used are self-explanatory and aid the navigation of the user, bringing an intuitive imagery to the website.

#### Colors
![Colors](wireframes/dusty_lantern_color_palette.png)

#393E46: 

#EEEEEE: 

#9A031E: 

While creating this color scheme, I have used the [Contrast-Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker "Contrast Checker") tool to assure a good readability across the website and decide between different color-pairings to be used in the apps.

|Text color  	|Background color  	|Result   	|
|---	        |---	            |---	    |
|#393E46|#EEEEEE|Very good|
|~~#393E46~~|~~#9A031E~~|~~Very poor~~|
|#EEEEEE|#393E46|Very good|
|#EEEEEE|#9A031E|Very good|
|~~#9A031E~~|~~#393E46~~|~~Very poor~~|
|#9A031E|#EEEEEE|Very good|
